# Evolutionary Machine Learning Workshop @PPSN18
Evolutionary machine-learning (EML) could be easily defined as a crossbreed
between the fields of evolutionary computation (EC) and machine learning (ML).
However, as the “obvious connection” between the processes of learning and
evolution has been pointed out by Turing back in 1950, to avoid a blatant
pleonasm, the term is mostly used referring to the integration of well-established
EC techniques and canonical ML frameworks.

A first line of research ascribable to EML predates the recent ML bonanza and
focuses on using EC algorithms to optimize frameworks: it included remarkable
studies in the 1990s, such as the attempts to determine optimal topologies for
an artificial neural network using a genetic algorithm. The other way around, a
line tackling the use of ML techniques to boost EC algorithms appeared before
2000\. More recently, scholars are proposing truly hybrid approaches, where EC
algorithms are deeply embedded in frameworks performing ML tasks.

The workshop’s topics of interest include but are not limited to:
- EA applied to ML tasks (e.g., evolutionary classifiers)
- EA applied to ML algorithms (e.g., evolutionary optimization of deep
neural network)
- ML applied to EA algorithms (e.g., optimal parameter prediction)
- Real world applications of EML
